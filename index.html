    <h1>Delicious Recipes</h1>
            <p>Here is a quick list of some of the most amazing recipes I have ever eaten in my life.
                Some of these have been passed down from generation to generation while some have
                been learned during long nights cooking for my wife and 2 lovely boys.

            <p>Want a great meal to feed a huge, tireless family? <strong>LASAGNA!</strong> I promise you 
                will not be disappointed! hearty and full of meat and sauce, this meal will satisfy the largest 
                of men and the crankiest of kids! This recipe was learned once during a a busy night. I had only 
                20 mins to prepare a meal and thankfully the oven did the rest!

            <p>This is a gem! just like the Lasagna, this cooks itself! with a little prep this meal can feed either 
                1 or an entire family. this recipe was acquired when i was stationed away from my family, my love for 
                pasta does not leave even when i am away! with this recipe i was able to tame the beast that is my 
                hunger all while having enough time to study!

        <h3> <a href="recipes/alfredo.html">Alfredo</a></h3>
             <p>Alfredo Alfredo! Where do I start!?! This dish is my all time favorite! I've fallen in love with so many
                different variations over the years of my life yet a simple Fettucine Alfredo has just always hit the spot 
                just right. from olive garden to a spicy cajun, you can make this meal your very own!
